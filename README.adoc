https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/OFBIZ/Keeping+OFBiz+secure[Keeping
OFBiz secure]

[[build-system-syntax]]
== Build system syntax

All build tasks are executed using the *Gradle* build system which is embedded
in OFBiz. To execute build tasks go to OFBiz top-level directory (folder) and
execute tasks from there.

[[operating-system-syntax]]
=== Operating System Syntax

The syntax for tasks differ slightly between windows and Unix-like systems

* *Windows*: `gradlew <tasks-in-here>`
* *Unix-like*: `./gradlew <tasks-in-here>`

For the rest of this document, we will use the windows syntax, if you are on a
Unix-like system, you need to add the `./` to gradlew

[[types-of-tasks-in-gradle]]
=== Types of tasks in Gradle

There are two types of tasks designed for OFBiz in Gradle:

* *Standard tasks*: To execute general standard Gradle tasks
* *OFBiz server tasks*: To execute OFBiz startup commands. These tasks start
with one of the following words:
* *ofbiz* : standard server commands
* *ofbizBackground* ; server commands running in a background forked process

Tips:

* OFBiz *server commands* require *"quoting"* the commands. For example:
`gradlew "ofbiz --help"`
* Shortcuts to task names can be used by writing the first letter of every word
in a task name. However, you cannot use the shortcut form for OFBiz server
tasks. Example: `gradlew loadAdminUserLogin -PuserLoginId=myadmin` =
`gradlew lAUL -PuserLoginId=myadmin`
* Dependent tasks can be skipped with the -x switch. Example:
`gradlew build -x test` does not run the tests within the build.

[[example-standard-tasks]]
==== Example standard tasks

`gradlew build`

`gradlew cleanAll loadAll testIntegration`

[[example-ofbiz-server-tasks]]
==== Example OFBiz server tasks

`gradlew "ofbiz --help"`

[[example-mixed-tasks-standard-and-ofbiz-server]]
==== Example mixed tasks (standard and OFBiz server)

`gradlew cleanAll loadAll "ofbiz --start --portoffset 10000"`



[[quick-reference]]
== Quick reference

You can use the below common list of tasks as a quick reference for controlling
the system. This document uses the windows task syntax, if you are on a
Unix-like system, you need to add the `./` to gradlew i.e. `./gradlew`



[[help-tasks]]

operating system kill command. Use this command to force OFBiz termination if
the --shutdown command does not work. Usually this is needed when in the middle
of data loading or testing in OFBiz.

Warning: Be careful in using this command as force termination might lead to
inconsistent state / data

`gradlew terminateOfbiz`

[[start-ofbiz-in-remote-debug-mode]]
==== Start OFBiz in remote debug mode

You can also offset the port, for example:

`gradlew "ofbizBackground --start --portoffset 10000"`

[[passing-jvm-runtime-options-to-ofbiz]]
==== Passing JVM runtime options to OFBiz

You can pass JVM runtime options by specifying the project property `-PjvmArgs`.

`gradlew ofbiz -PjvmArgs="-Xms1024M -Xmx2048M" -Dsome.parameter=hello`

If you do not specify `jvmArgs`, a default of `-Xms128M -Xmx1024M` is set.



[[data-loading-tasks]]
=== Data loading tasks

OFBiz contains the following data reader types:

* *seed*: OFBiz and External Seed Data - to be maintained along with source and
updated whenever a system deployment is updated
* *seed-initial*: OFBiz and External Seed Data - to be maintained along with
source like other seed data, but only loaded initially and not updated when a
system is updated except manually reviewing each line
* *demo*: OFBiz Only Demo Data
* *ext*: External General Data (custom)
* *ext-test*: External Test Data (custom)
* *ext-demo*: External Demo Data (custom)
* *tenant*: Data to load into the master tenants database "ofbiztenant". This
data is required to identify where a tenant's database is located. For more
information you can review the relevant
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/OFBIZ/Multitenancy+support[tenant
documentation]

Available options for the --load-data server command are the following:

* *readers=[name]*: only load data from certain readers separated by comma. e.g.
seed,seed-initial,ext
* *file=[path]*: load a single file from location or several files separated by
commas. e.g. /my/file/1,/my/file/2
* *dir=[path]*: load all data files found in directory
* *component=[name]*: only load data from a specific component. e.g. base
* *delegator=[name]*: use the defined delegator. Default is "default". If the
value passed is *"all-tenants"* then OFBiz will load the data for all defined
tenants in the system.
* *group=[name]*: override the entity group (org.apache.ofbiz). e.g.
com.example.something
* *timeout=[millis]*: timeout in milliseconds
* *create-pks*: create primary keys
* *drop-pks*: drop primary keys
* *create-constraints*: create indexes and foreign keys after loading
* *drop-constraints*: drop indexes and foreign keys before loading
* *create-fks*: create dummy (placeholder) foreign keys
* *maintain-txs*: maintain timestamps in data file
* *try-inserts*: use mostly inserts
* *repair-columns*: repair column sizes (default is true w/ drop-constraints)
* *continue-on-failure*: By default OFBiz will fail and stop if it is unable to
load any of the files it is attempting to load. By passing this property OFBiz
will ignore failures and continue loading all files

[[load-specific-ofbiz-data]]
==== Load specific OFBiz data

you can choose which data readers to pass in the following syntax:

`gradlew "ofbiz --load-data readers=<readers-here-comma-separated>"`

Example:

`gradlew "ofbiz --load-data readers=seed,seed-initial,ext,ext-demo"`

 Beware that copying this command in Microsoft Word will automatically transform
the double dash in en dashes (Unicode 0x2013: â) Other cases not related to Word
were also reported.So when this command does not work check that you are using
dash! text

[[load-all-ofbiz-data]]
==== Load all OFBiz data

Loads all data sets; meant for initial loading of generic OFBiz data. Can be
applied for development, testing, demonstration, etc. purposes. Be aware that
executing this task can result in your data being overwritten in your database
of choice. Use with caution in production environments.

`gradlew loadAll`

OR

`gradlew "ofbiz --load-data"`

[[load-seed-data]]
==== Load seed data

Load ONLY the seed data (not seed-initial, demo, ext* or anything else); meant
for use after an update of the code to reload the seed data as it is generally
maintained along with the code and needs to be in sync for operation

`gradlew "ofbiz --load-data readers=seed"`

[[load-ext-data]]
==== load ext data

Load seed, seed-initial and ext data; meant for manual/generic testing,
development, or going into production with a derived system based on stock OFBiz
where the ext data basically replaces the demo data

`gradlew "ofbiz --load-data readers=seed,seed-initial,ext"`

[[load-ext-test-data]]
==== load ext test data

Load seed, seed-initial, ext and ext-test data; meant for automated testing with
a derived system based on stock OFBiz

[[run-owasp-tool-to-identify-dependency-vulnerabilities-cves]]
==== Run OWASP tool to identify dependency vulnerabilities (CVEs)

The below command activates a gradle plugin (OWASP) and Identifies and reports
known vulnerabilities (CVEs) in OFBiz library dependencies. The task takes time
to complete, and once done, a report will be generated in
$OFBIZ_HOME/build/reports/dependency-check-report.html

`gradlew -PenableOwasp dependencyCheckAnalyze`

[[setup-eclipse-project-for-ofbiz]]
==== Setup eclipse project for OFBiz

Setting up OFBiz on eclipse is done by simply running the below command and then
importing the project to eclipse. This command will generate the necessary
*.classpath* and *.project* files for eclipse and it will also make the source
code for external libraries available in eclipse (i.e. you can view source
through Ctrl + Click)

The first time you run this command it will take a long time to execute because
it will download source packages available for project dependencies.

`gradlew eclipse`

[[package-and-distribute-ofbiz]]
==== Package and distribute OFBiz

In order to deploy OFBiz on a target system and in particular in a production
environment without requiring the target system to download Gradle and OFBiz
dependencies from the internet, it is possible to generate an archive bundling
OFBiz with all the Jars it depends on as a `tar` archive

`gradlew distTar`

or as a `zip` archive.

`gradlew distZip`

Those archives are available in the `build/distributions` directory.  To run
OFBiz from those archive you must first unarchive them with `tar xf` or `unzip`
and then from that directory you can run either `bin/ofbiz` shell script or
`bin/ofbiz.bat` batch script with the appropriate ofbiz options.

[[ofbiz-plugin-system]]
== OFBiz plugin system

OFBiz provides an extension mechanism through plugins. Plugins are standard
OFBiz components that reside in the plugins directory. Plugins can be added
manually or fetched from a maven repository. The standard tasks for managing
plugins are listed below.

__________________________________________________________________________________
_Note_: OFBiz plugin versions follow http://semver.org/[Semantic Versioning
2.0.0]
__________________________________________________________________________________

[[pull-download-and-install-a-plugin-automatically]]
=== Pull (download and install) a plugin automatically

Download a plugin with all its dependencies (plugins) and install them
one-by-one starting with the dependencies and ending with the plugin itself.

`gradlew pullPlugin -PdependencyId="org.apache.ofbiz.plugin:myplugin:0.1.0"`

If the plugin resides in a custom maven repository (not jcenter or localhost)
then you can use specify the repository using below command:

`gradlew pullPlugin -PrepoUrl="http://www.example.com/custom-maven" -PdependencyId="org.apache.ofbiz.plugin:myplugin:0.1.0"`

If you need username and password to access the custom repository:

`gradlew pullPlugin -PrepoUrl="http://www.example.com/custom-maven" -PrepoUser=myuser -PrepoPassword=mypassword -PdependencyId="org.apache.ofbiz.plugin:myplugin:0.1.0"`

[[pull-an-official-plugin-from-source-control]]
=== Pull an official plugin from source control

Download an official plugin from source control (currently subversion) and place
it in the plugins directory. In addition, this task also executes the "install"
task if it is defined for the plugin being downloaded.

This task is mostly useful when working on the trunk branch as it pulls in the
latest version of a plugin.

`gradlew pullPluginSource -PpluginId=ecommerce`

________________________________________________________________________________________
_Note_: This plugin will have its own .svn directory placed inside the plugin
directory.
________________________________________________________________________________________

[[pull-all-official-plugins-from-source-control]]
=== Pull all official plugins from source control

Download all officially supported plugins from source control (currently
subversion) and place them inclusive of their ".svn" directory in /plugins.
WARNING! This task deletes the /plugins directory and replaces it with the
official plugins.

`gradlew pullAllPluginsSource`

This task makes it easy to download and develop officially supported plugins. It
is mostly used by developers or individuals working on the trunk branch. We do
not recommend using this task on releases of OFBiz, instead consider using the
"pullPlugin" task to get the correct version of a plugin compatible with your
release.

____________________________________________________________________________________
_Note_: All the plugins will share a .svn directory placed in the plugins
directory.
____________________________________________________________________________________

[[install-a-plugin]]
=== Install a plugin

If you have a plugin called mycustomplugin and want to install it in OFBiz
follow the below instructions:

* Extract the plugin if it is compressed
* Place the extracted directory into /plugins
* Run the below command

`gradlew installPlugin -PpluginId=myplugin`

The above commands executes the task "install" in the plugin's build.gradle file
if it exists

[[uninstall-a-plugin]]
=== Uninstall a plugin

If you have an existing plugin called mycustomplugin and you wish to uninstall
run the below command

`gradlew uninstallPlugin -PpluginId=myplugin`

The above command executes the task "uninstall" in the plugin's build.gradle
file if it exists

[[remove-a-plugin]]
=== Remove a plugin

Calls *uninstallPlugin* on an existing plugin and then delete it from the
file-system

`gradlew removePlugin -PpluginId=myplugin`

[[create-a-new-plugin]]
=== Create a new plugin

Create a new plugin. The following project parameters are passed:

* pluginId: mandatory
* pluginResourceName: optional, default is the Capitalized value of pluginId
* webappName: optional, default is the value of pluginId
* basePermission: optional, default is the UPPERCASE value of pluginId

`gradlew createPlugin -PpluginId=myplugin`

`gradlew createPlugin -PpluginId=myplugin -PpluginResourceName=MyPlugin -PwebappName=mypluginweb -PbasePermission=MYSECURITY`

The above command creates a new plugin in /plugins/myplugin

[[push-a-plugin-to-a-repository]]
=== Push a plugin to a repository

This task publishes an OFBiz plugin into a maven package and then uploads it to
a maven repository. Currently, pushing is limited to localhost maven repository
(work in progress). To push a plugin the following parameters are passed:

* pluginId: mandatory
* groupId: optional, defaults to org.apache.ofbiz.plugin
* pluginVersion: optional, defaults to 0.1.0-SNAPSHOT
* pluginDescription: optional, defaults to "Publication of OFBiz plugin
$\{pluginId}"

`gradlew pushPlugin -PpluginId=myplugin`

`gradlew pushPlugin -PpluginId=mycompany -PpluginGroup=com.mycompany.ofbiz.plugin -PpluginVersion=1.2.3 -PpluginDescription="Introduce special functionality X"`

issues]

[[repository-and-directory-structure]]
=== Repository and directory structure

OFBiz is split into two repositories:

* *ofbiz-framework*: Contains the core framework and main applications in the
system like accounting, party, order, etc
* *ofbiz-plugins*: Renamed from "special-purpose" and contains optional
components that are officially supported by the community

Furthermore, the hot-deploy directory is removed as the plugins directory works
as a replacement for both "special-purpose" and "hot-deploy".

If you need to load the components in the plugins directory in a specific order
place a component-load.xml file in the plugins directory listing the order.

To check out a plugin from source control use the *pullPluginSource* Gradle
task. To check out all plugins from source control use the
*pullAllPluginsSource*. *Beware* this deletes a previously existing plugins
directory.

[[running-gradle-tasks-without-an-internet-connection]]
=== Running gradle tasks without an internet connection

OFBiz must run with an internet connection the *first time* it is prepared on
the system because it needs to download all the required dependencies.

After preparing OFBiz the first time correctly, it is possible to run OFBiz
without an internet connection by using the `--offline` command line switch
which tells Gradle to fetch its dependencies from the cache.

If any dependencies are missing from the cache and you pass `--offline` switch
then the build execution will fail.

[[setup-an-external-database-like-mysql-postgresql-etc]]
=== Setup an external database like MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc

To setup an external database instead of the default embedded Apache Derby, you
will need to follow the following instructions:

1.  Find the JDBC driver suitable for your database using one of the following
options:

* Search for the JDBC driver in https://bintray.com/bintray/jcenter[jcenter] and
place it in build.gradle dependencies e.g.
`runtime 'mysql:mysql-connector-java:5.1.36'`
+
OR
* Download the JDBC driver jar and place it in $OFBIZ_HOME/lib or the lib
sub-directory of any component

2.  Modify the entityengine.xml file located in
$OFBIZ_HOME/framework/entity/config to switch the default database to the one
you selected. For more details you can read the relevant section in the
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/OFBIZ/Apache+OFBiz+Technical+Production+Setup+Guide[technical
setup guide]

[[setup-gradle-tab-completion-on-unix-like-systems]]
=== Setup gradle tab-completion on Unix-like systems:

To get tab completion (auto complete gradle commands by pressing tab) you can
download the script from the below link and place it in the appropriate location
for your system.

https://edub.me/gradle-completion-bash[Gradle tab completion]

For example, on debian based systems, you can use the following command:

`sudo curl -L -s https://edub.me/gradle-completion-bash -o /etc/bash_completion.d/gradle-tab-completion.bash`
