Place your custom jar files in here.

If you want to use a public open source library, it is recommended
that you do not place the library in here. Instead declare it as a
dependency in your build scripts (build.gradle files) by finding the
appropriate library in jcenter (https://bintray.com/bintray/jcenter)
