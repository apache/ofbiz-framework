= How to Create the main Company

OFBiz needs to have at least on main company set up that will represent the main business or organization. +
If you have installed OFBiz with the demo data then the main company already exists. +
If you have installed OFBiz without the demo data then it will not exist so you will need to create it.

This is is done in Party Manager.

NOTE: Party Manager is the application where we create all the entities
 (companies, people, groups, departments) that we deal with in the course of doing business.

This tutorial is quite simple, only 4 step.

== step Party
1. Login to OFBiz
2. Create Party
   * Select “Party” from the Applications drop down menu if you are not already in
   * Click “Create New Party Group” +
     The company we are creating is not an individual (person, customer, prospect or employee).
     It is an organization and in OFBiz this is called a "party group" (a group of people)
3. fill in the form fields
   * Party ID (e.g COMPANY) +
    (NOTE: that you can enter the Party ID manually. If it is not entered OFBiz will auto generate an ID.
           If you enter the ID it will make it easier to locate it quickly in future;
           but it’s dangerous to create wrong ID, in ID only standard characters and without space are authorized. ID length must be less than 20 characters.
           Best practice is to use only UpperCase.)

   * Group Name (e.g  “My OFBiz Main Company”). This will be the name of your company)
   * it's possible to leave al other field blank
4. Click “Save”

You are now on profile page.

== step Address
Next we need to enter some contact details. Find the "Contact Information" section (box)

1. Click "Create" on the screenlet title
2. Select "Postal Address"
3. Click "Create"
4. fill in the form fields
   * Address Line 1
   * Address Line 2 (not mandatory)
   * City
   * State / Province (not mandatory)
   * Zip / Postal Code
   * Country
5. Click Save

The address is added - but - there is still some missing setup.

== step Address purpose
We need to include a purpose (or use) for the address.

1. Click “Update” next to the address details
2. Select "Primary Address" and Click "Add Purpose
3. Select "Shipping Origin Address" and Click "Add Purpose"
4. Select "Shipping Destination Address" and Click "Add Purpose"
5. click to GoBack or on Profile in the screen-sub-menu

The address purpose is be updated.

== step role
We now need to add a specific role to this party group to let OFBiz know that is an organization
that will have an accounting setup.

1. Click "Roles" in screen-sub-menu
2. In the 'Add to Role : view All' section, use the dropdown box to:
   * Select the Role Type Id "Internal Organization"
3. Click "Add"

The internal organization role will be added to our new Party Group.

Now this is done we can begin the Accounting setup.
