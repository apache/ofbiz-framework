== Return Process Overview
Sales Return is merchandise returned back to the seller by a customer. Sales return is a common concept used in sales and
purchase terminology. The main purpose of the sales return is to provide easy returns to the customers to maintain long
relationships with them.

While viewing an existing order, you can create a return from that order by clicking on the [Create Return]
button (in Action section). That will take you to the quickreturn screen, from where
you identify which item(s) the customers wants to return.

A sales return can be created for one of the following Reasons:

* Excess quantity shipped
* Excess quantity ordered
* Defective Goods
* Goods shipped too late
* Product specifications are incorrect
* Wrong items shipped

Sales Return types can be:

* Store credit
* Refund
* Exchange
* Store credit replacement

When a product is returned, the process impacts many different components of your business. Consider:

. Customer must coordinate the physical return of the item(s) with your company.
   This is controlled by the document called the 'Return'.
   Be sure the Customer encloses a copy of the Return with his package or at least includes the Return ID on the shipping label
   and documents.
. Your Facility needs to be alerted that the item(s) will be coming in from a source other than a regular supplier.
. The value of the returned item(s) must be credited back to the Customer.
. Taxes credited to taxing authorities must be reversed.
. Costs for shipping, handling, perhaps re-shelving, must all be accounted for.
. Possible replacement of the item must go through the entire Order Fulfillment chain.
. The returned item(s) must be inspected with a determination made whether to:
   .. place an item back into Inventory for re-sale; OR
   .. repair/ re-furbish/ re-packag before return to Inventory; OR
   .. return a defective product to YOUR supplier for credit or refund; OR
   .. dispose of it with a loss write-off.
. Adjustments must be made to Inventory, Sales Figures, perhaps to Sales Commissions, and other records within the company.

As you scroll through the screens, try to envision how each of these areas are impacted within the Company.
Realize that the Order Manager, Work Effort Manager, Accounting Manager, and Facility Manager are primary players.
The Marketing Manager and perhaps the Manufacturing Manager might be involved if some adjustments are needed.

Fortunately, the systems set up within Open For Business have automated much of this for you.
However, by understanding the entire process, you can better stay alert for steps that might be needed as returns come back
to your company.

== Sales Return Diagrams
=== Create Sales Return

A customer requests for the return of the product. The reason for returning the merchandise can be defective goods,
incorrect product specification, excess quantity shipped or wrong items shipped.
The <<CSR>> accepts the return request and fills out the return details and creates a return with respect to the sales order.

== Sales Return management in UI
=== Quick Return
While viewing an existing order, you can create a return from that order by clicking on the [Create Return] button
(actions section).That will take you to the quickreturn screen, from where you identify which item(s) the customers wants
to return.

Be clear about the reason and the quantity to be returned. Also be sure that the Return Price does not exceed how much
the customer actually paid for the item. +
Return Type is important because it is always to your advantage to have the purchase price applied as a credit towards
another purchase rather than having to take money out of your business to pay a refund.

When the information is correctly selected and entered, click the link[Return Selected Items] to create the Return. +
Next screen show you Return Request creation successful, and you can directly [Accept Return]

That also takes you to the Returns tab, Return Items sub-tab, discussed further below.

Notice you can:

* select All (check box)
* choose *Return Qty*, just behind Order Qty +
  Be sure this does not exceed the Order Qty. If that attempt ismade, have them return any surplus against another order
  from where they probably obtained it.
* *Return Price*, just behind Unit Price +
  The Price at which the customer will be credited. This is a mandatory field (*). +
  For example, if the customer received a promotional discount of 10% on a $100 item, you would not return $100
  (the Unit Price) but only the discounted price of $90 which they originally paid for it.
* *Return Reason* +
  Select the best-stated reason for the return. Remember that Returns need to be approved. Some items may be sold with
  a re-shelving fee, others may be close-outs with no returns authorized. +
  If reason you want is not listed, Additional reasons can be programmed into the system as their need develops
  (or just added by a administrator via webtools if it's only for better information). +
  Why is a reason needed? This information is used when receiving the return to help decide whether to put the item back
  into inventory,throw it out, schedule it for repairs, etc. +
  Choices in the drop-down box might include:
  ** Defective Item
  ** Did Not Want Item
  ** Miss-Shipped Item
  ** Digital Fulfillment Failed
* *Return Type* +
  This establishes how the financial aspects of the return will be handled.
  Choices in the drop-down box might include:
  ** Store Credit
  ** Refund
  ** Replacement
  ** Cross-Ship Replacement
* *Item Status* +
  What is the current status of the Item? +
  The status could be one of the following:
  ** ---, the item status is unknown
  ** On Order, the item was not yet shipped but is no longer wanted
  ** Available, the item is in your facility
  ** Promised,  the item is committed to fulfilling another order
  ** Delivered, the item is on its way to the Customer now wanting to return it
  ** Being Transferred, the item is being moved from one location or section to another
  ** Being Transferred (Promised),  the item is being moved AND it has already been committed to fulfilling another order
  ** Returned, the item has physically been sent back from the customer to your facilities
  ** Defective, whatever the location or other status may be, the item itself is considered defective
     and should not be promised to fulfill another order.
* *Select a ship from address* +
