<!-- these SECAs are for automatically creating accounting transactions based on business transactions.  
     They should normally be "sync" SECAs so that they happen as soon
     as the business transactions are ready, and so that if the accounting transactions can't be created,
     the user will get an error.  This is to avoid cases where business transactions are created but in limbo
     because accounting transactions can't be created. -->
