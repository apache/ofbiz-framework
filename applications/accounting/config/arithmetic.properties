# For setting decimal precision and rounding method of operations related to orders,
# such as shopping cart amounts and order amounts

order.rounding = ROUND_HALF_UP

# For setting decimal precision and rounding method of operations related to customer accounts
# such as Financial Accounts

# Most companies would want their sales tax calculations ALWAYS to round up (ie, 100.081 becomes 100.09)
# This could be ROUND_CEILING or ROUND_UP.  (The difference is that ROUND_CEILING rounds towards positive infinity,
# ROUND_UP away from zero.  So, for 1.13, both ROUND_UP and ROUND_CEILING will round to 1.2, but for -1.13,
# ROUND_UP gives you -1.2 and ROUND_CEILING -1.1.)
