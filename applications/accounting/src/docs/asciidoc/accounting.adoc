= Accounting

The OFBiz accounting system is a core application component and has most of the
modern features you would expect in a general purpose double-entry accounting
system. However, OFBiz goes beyond that by and seamlessly integrates with other
OFBiz applications such as Inventory, Purchasing and Manufacturing to give your
business a complete ERP solution. This makes the system as a whole robust and 
integrated to provide more value than a plain accounting system.
