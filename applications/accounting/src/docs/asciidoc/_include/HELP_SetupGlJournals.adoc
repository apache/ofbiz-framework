= Help for Journals
A journal is a detailed accounting transaction that is recorded (or posted) to the General Ledger.
It is made up of a debit and a credit component.

NOTE: TO CHECK: Is this screen really about Journals or is it about Suspense Accounts.....??????)

NOTE: By default in OFBIZ a journal called 'ERROR_JOURNAL' is created as part of the demo data installation. +
      This 'ERROR_JOURNAL' is referenced in the Accounting Preferences setup for 'Company'. +
      The 'ERROR_JOURNAL' is used to store details of any transaction that fails and cannot be posted to a general ledger account. +
      Transactions falling into error can be as the result of incomplete setup or an invalid transaction
      (eg a transaction that should never occur).

== How do I create a journal?
. Enter a journal name in the Gl Journal Name field (eg MY_JOURNAL)
. Press the 'Submit' button
. The journal is created and will appear in the journal list at the bottom of the screen +
   (Note that the Journal ID is automatically generated)

== How do I update a journal?
. Select the journal to be updated from the list of journals at the bottom of the screen
. The journal details will be displayed on the screen
. Update the Gl Journal Name (as this is currently the only field that can be updated)
. Press the 'Submit' button
. The updated journal will appear in the journal list at the bottom of the screen

== How do I delete a journal?
Be careful if you need to remove an existing journal as it may have transactions associated with it.

. Press the 'Remove' button next to the journal that you want to delete
. The journal is deleted and the screen is redisplayed
