= About Accounting

The Accounting system is organised according to generally accepted principles
such as double-entry accounting, a General Ledger with hierarchical accounts,
journals and posting of transactions and corresponding entries.

The structure is primary based on the OMG GL standard and the work that was done
on an AR/AP extension of the OMG GL standard. This correlates well with other
standards such as ebXML and OAGIS.

The Accounting entities are structured such that accounts for multiple
organisations can be managed. The multiple organisations could be multiple
companies, or departments or other organisations within a company. Each
organisation can have various GL Accounts associated with it so that it can
operate with its own subset of the Master Chart of Accounts.

Each organisation can also have its own set of Journals for flexibility, even
though the use of Journals should be as minimal as possible in favour of allowing
the system to automatically create and post transactions based on business events
triggered by standard procedures and documents such as purchase and sales orders,
invoices, inventory transfers, payments, receipts, and so on.
