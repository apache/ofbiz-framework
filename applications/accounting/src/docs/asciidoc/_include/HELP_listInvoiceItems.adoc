= Help for Edit Invoice Items
The Invoice Items screen displays the individual invoice line details and allows the user to update or remove an entry.
As each invoice line is created it is allocated a specific sequence (or Item Number) which acts as a unique identifier.

== How do I create a new invoice line item?
Note that only invoices that have specific statuses can have new line items created.
This means that if an invoice has already been paid and processed OFBiz will not allow any amendments to it.

. Select the 'Items' sub menu for the invoice
. The 'Add a new invoice item' screen will be displayed
. Leave the 'Item No' field blank (as it will be automatically generated)
. Select the 'Invoice Item Type' from the drop down box +
  (NOTE: A typical line using the demo could be 'Invoice Finished Good Item' but ensure that it corresponds with
   the type of products setup in your catalog)
. Enter a description describing what the line item is +
  (NOTE: If you are going to enter a product in the Product Id field from the catalog then leave the 'Description' field
   blank as it will be used to show the product description)
. Leave the 'Override GL Account Id' field blank as it will use the default account based on the Chart of Accounts setup
. Use the lookup or enter a product code in the 'Product Id' field +
  (NOTE: This can be left blank if your invoice line is not related to a product in the catalog)
. Enter a number in the 'Quantity' field
. Enter a 'Unit Price' only if the Product Id field is blank +
  (NOTE: If a Product Id has been entered then leave the 'Unit Price' field blank as it will pick up the product price
  from the catalog)
. Leave the 'Inventory Item' field blank
. Leave the 'Product Feature Id' field blank
. Leave the 'UOM' field blank
. Select 'Yes' for the 'Taxable Flag' field

WARNING: TO CHECK: Need to do some tests to see what line item type needs to be used for 'Sales Tax'. +
     I think that it could be 'Invoice Item Sales Tax' since tax is currently calculated at invoice item line level. +
     Also the automatically generated invoices from Order Entry and E-Commerce show taxes at the invoice item line level
     (think there may be some work going on - see JIRA on to consolidate entries). +
     Need to do some tests using 'Invoice Sales Tax' to see how it works.........

== How do I update an invoice line item?
Not all the fields on the invoice item line can be updated.
For example Taxable Flag and Inventory Item cannot be updated.

If these fields need to be amended then the invoice item will need to be removed and then re-created.

. Select the 'Items' sub menu for the invoice
. Any existing line items will be displayed in the 'Items' box
. Amend the details in the line item that needs to be updated (eg Quantity, Invoice Item Type, Product Id, Description,
  Override GL Account, Unit Price)
. Press the 'Update' button displayed at the end of the line item that has been updated

== How do I delete an invoice item?
. Select the 'Items' sub menu for the invoice
. Any existing line items will be displayed in the 'Items' box
. Press the 'Remove' button displayed at the end of the line item that needs to be deleted
