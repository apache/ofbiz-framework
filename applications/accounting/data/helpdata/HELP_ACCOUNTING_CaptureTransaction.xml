    <title>The Capture Transaction help screen. </title>
    <para>This screen is used to input or 'capture' a payment against a Sales Order. Unlike the
        authorise, this function will actually deduct the amount from eg a credit card and apply the
        payment to a specific order.</para>
    <para>It is likely that the before the payment is 'captured' in this screen, it would have been
        through an authorisation first.</para>
    <para>NOTE TO CHECK: Investigate how this links in with the Payment Gateway Configurations
        screens</para>
