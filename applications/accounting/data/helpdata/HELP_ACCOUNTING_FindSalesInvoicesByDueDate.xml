    <title>The Find Sales Invoices By Due Date help screen.
    </title>
    <para>This screen allows the user to search for and locate Sales
        Invoices based on their due date. The 'Due Date' can be defined as the
        last possible date that payments can be received for the invoice
        without triggering late payment penalties. The 'Invoice Date' can be
        defined as the date that the invoice was created and this is normally
        based on when products were shipped or services were provided.</para>
       
    <para>NOTE TO CHECK: There appears to be a minor bug here as if the
        Invoice 'Due Date' is different to the Invoice Date (eg. Invoice
        Creation Date) then the Invoice Date is used as the Due Date in this
        screen which I dont think is correct......</para>

    <para>A Sales Invoice may be due to be paid immediately or as in some
        cases the customer is given a 'grace period' after which the invoice
        is generated and becomes due. Examples of this include only generating
        a customer invoice after a certain amount of time after the dispatch
        of their order. (NOTE: There are several ways this can be achieved in
        OFBiz including the use of agreements and billing accounts).
    </para>
    <para>This screen can be used to locate Sales Invoices as follows:
    </para><itemizedlist>
    <listitem><para>That will become due within a fixed timeframe (eg the next 5
        days)</para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>That may already be overdue</para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>That have been automatically generated by the system (eg as a
        result of Agreements based on payment in 30 days etc....TO CHECK)
    </para></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>NOTE: See details from Jacopo below regarding future work
        regarding Find Sales Invoice by Due Date and Find Purchase Invoice by
        Due Date functionality:</para>

    <para>* The two links are used to search invoices' due dates for
        payments - there are plans to add links to quickly create payments for
        them etc. So they are somewhat in the middle between an invoice thing
        and a payment thing. By the way, for now I will close this issue
        because
        the best spot to place them is in the AR and AP applications,
        but there
        is still a lot of work to do to make them usable. </para>
