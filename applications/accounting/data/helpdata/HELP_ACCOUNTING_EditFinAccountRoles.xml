    <title>The Edit Financial Account Roles screen.</title>
    <para>The Financial Account Roles sub menu screen allows you specify a party and link them to a
        role for a particular financial account.</para>
    <para>It can be used to add party roles eg 'Approver' or 'Administrator' for credit limits or
        updates to the account. If an account belongs to a company then you may want to add a person
        as a 'Contact' for dealing with the account.</para>
    <para>The roles can also be time bound. This means that you can specify a start and end date for
        the party role.</para>
