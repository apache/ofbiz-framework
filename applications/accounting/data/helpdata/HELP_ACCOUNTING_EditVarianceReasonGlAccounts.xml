 <title>The Variance Reason GL Accounts help screen</title>
 <para>The Variance Reason / GL Account default is used for mapping any
  stock differences to a particular general ledger account. If there are
  variances in the number of products that are in stock then this
  affects the value of inventory in the general ledger. By using this GL
  default you can offset any differences in stock to the relevant
  general ledger account.</para>
 <para>The number of products (or items) in stock can vary. These
  differences can be caused by numerous reasons. Some of these could be
  as follows:</para>
 <itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
   <para>Products have been damaged</para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>Products were lost or stolen</para>

  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>Free samples or giveaways to potential clients</para>
  </listitem>
 </itemizedlist>

  inventory adjustment is done through the Inventory Item screens.
