    <title>The Find Purchase Invoices By Due Date help screen.
    </title>
    <para>This screen allows the user to search for and locate Purchase
        Invoices based on their due date. The 'Due Date' can be defined as the
        last possible date that payments can be received for the invoice
        without triggering any late payment penalties. The 'Invoice Date' can
        be defined as the date that the invoice was created and this is
        normally based on when products were received or services were
        provided.</para>
    <para>NOTE TO CHECK: See if the same bug that exists with Sales
        Invoices is here too.</para>
    <para>A Purchase Invoice may be due to be paid immediately or you may
        be given a 'grace period' after which the invoice is due.</para>
