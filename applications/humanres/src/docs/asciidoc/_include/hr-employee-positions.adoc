= Employee Positions
An employee position is also called a job position. It is a role that has been
created to perform a specific task within the Company. This means that it has
approved funding to pay it.

Employee positions are defined by:

* the work description and responsibilities
* a pay structure (e.g. hourly wages, salary, contract etc)
* full-time or part-time
* the skills needed to fullfill the position

NOTE: An employee positions is not the same as a person fullfilling the role.
A person fulfilling an employee position is called an employee

An employee position can be fullfilled (i.e. someone is currently working in the
role) or it can be unfulfilled (i.e. a job vacancy).

NOTE: In some cases an employee position could also be considered a full-time
 equivalent (FTE) and can be assigned to more than one person (e.g. job sharing)

In the OFBiz Human Resources application you can:

* Create employee positions
* Fulfill employee positions
* Define the responsibilities of an employee position
* Define a tree reporting structure between employee positions
* Track employment position fulfillments over time
