= Skills

Skills are the basic foundation of any Human Resources function as it is a key
factor in identifying the suitability of someone to perform a specific task or
job. They can often be divided into two types; general and specific, and are
characterised by things such as years of experience, rating or level of
expertise.

In OFBiz basic skills can be defined in Global HR Settings and then linked to
actual individuals via the Skills menu option.

In the recruitment process, skills are specified as part of the job requisition
for an employee (or job) position. This helps ensure that the recruiter can focus
on finding applicants with the relevant skillset.

Your employees can also gain new skills as part of their employment and so OFBiz
 allows you to record and track their newly acquired skills. It may be that
rather than start a new recruitment process, you may be able to find someone
with the right skills from your existing employees.


In the OFBiz Human Resources application you can

* Assign or link skills to job applicants (i.e. non employees)
* Assign or link skills to existing employees
* Search for existing employees that have the required skills for a job
