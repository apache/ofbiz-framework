= Recruitment

Recruitment is an important function in any organisation. It is a set of processes
that allow you to specify, search for candidates to fulfill the roles that you
have available.

When you have a job position that needs to be fulfilled, you can create a Job
Requisition. The job requisition identifies the skills, qualifications, experience
and also the number of resources needed for a position.

NOTE: Currently the default assumption is that the Job Requisition is for an
Internal Job posting

Once the requisition is created, you can then create Job Posting based on the
requisition. For example if the requisition was for three (3) roles then three
job postings can be created (each with different application deadlines) one to
fulfill each of the positions.

People can then apply for the positions and send in their CVs or Resumes. You
can track the progress of the the application and also create details about
various types of job interviews needed (e.g. HR, Panel, Case Study
 /Practical Test etc) and link it to the requisition.

You can also track the status of people who have applied for a position.

In the OFBiz Human Resource application you can

* Approve or reject job applications
* Manage and book job interviews
* Record the result of job interviews
