= Resumes

Resumes or Curriculum Vitae (CVs) are documents that job applicants use to apply
 for job positions. These documents summarise the applicant's experience,
qualifications, contact information and details about why they are suitable for
 a particular job position.

In OFBiz you can enter a resume as a document and then link it to a person.
Each resume entry has a unique identifier (that currently needs to be manually
entered!). This identifier links a person to an instance of their resume.

NOTE: The OFBiz Content Manager application is used for the linking of resumes
because it was designed for managing, storing and retrieving electronic data in
varying formats - such as text, images, MS Word, PDF or even web URL's.
