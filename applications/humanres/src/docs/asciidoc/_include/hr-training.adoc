[#Introduction]
Introduction::
Training and professional development is important for an organisation because it 
can help to fill any gaps in skills and improve the proficiency of the existing 
workforce.
The training section of the HR module includes a Training Calendar where new 
training classes or events can be scheduled for an organisation.
Users that have HR administration permissions can create, assign and approve 
training classes. All other users can view the list of classes available, their 
training status and any requests they have made to enroll for training. 

[#HR Trainiing Process Flow]
General Process Flow::
* Training classes are created in the Global HR Training Class Type screen
* Training classes are scheduled and added to the training calendar
* Employees can create a request to attend a training
* The employee supervisor needs to approve or reject the employee training request
* Employees can check the status of the training requests

Training Calendar::
The main screen in the Training feature is the Training Calendar. This is where 
you add classes and class participants. You can navigate the calendar by clicking 
the navigation text for day, week and month views located in the calendar title bar.

Add New Training Event::
Training classes are created in the Training Calendar by clicking the Add New text 
command located in each calendar day cell. This action opens a small window above 
the calendar to enter the training class details.

NOTE: If you try to create a class and do not have correct User permissions, you 
will get an error. After a class is created a numeric class identifier and text 
identifier description appear in the calendar for the day of the class.

Request Training / Add a Training Participant ::
Participants can be added to a class by clicking on the class identifier. If you 
are the creator of the class the Participants window above and to the right of the
 calendar opens. You can add participants by entering their party id and clicking
 the Add button. The list of participants is displayed and updated. 
After a new participant is added to a training class or event, they are given the 
default status ‘Assigned’. 

Approve Training::
To approve a request for training, tor training administrator navigates to the 
Training Approvals screen and locates all requests with a status of "Assigned".  
They look up the person listed as the approver party. After checking with the 
approver they click update button to open the approval screen. In the approval 
screen the administrator sets the Approver Status and adds a reason for the 
decision. The user can see the status of their training schedule by clicking on 
the Training Status menu.

WARNING:  Something isn’t working correctly in 16.11. The there is no update 
button to click to approve a participant for training.
