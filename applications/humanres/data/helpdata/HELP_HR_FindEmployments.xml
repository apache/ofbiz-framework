  <title>Employments</title>

    <para>An employment is a relationship between a person and your Company.
    The Human Resources application tracks employment benefits, pay history, unemployment claims
    and employment agreements for each employed person.</para>

    <para>When you create new employee, an employee relationship is created
    automatically. </para>
    <para> NOTE: If a person was entered into the application by some other means 
    then you will have to create the employee relationship manually in the Party Manager
    application.</para>

    <para>The employment record includes the start and end date of the
    employment. When the employment ends you include the type of termination
    and a reason. </para>
    <para>For example, an employee may have been let go because of poor
    performance. (In this case the 'type' could be 'fired and the reason could be 'poor performance')</para>
  
    <para>The Employments screen can be used to create an employment or search for existing
      employments.</para>
