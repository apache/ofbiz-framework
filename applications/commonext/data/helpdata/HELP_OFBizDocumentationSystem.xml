  <title>The Apache OFBiz documentation system</title>
    <section>
      <title>Overview</title>
      <para>
          The OFBiz documentation system consist out of a number of DocBook xml
          files. In general the files are stored within the subject
          component either in the 'documents' or data/helpdata
          directories.
          The docbook schemas are stored in the applications/content/dtd
          directory and the stylesheets are
          stored in the applications/content/templates/docbook directory.
      </para>
      <para>
          The definition of the content and dataresource records can be found in
          the application/content/data/ContentType.xml file at the
          bottom. They are in this file because the documentation and
          helpfile are considered 'seed' data: essential for the operation of OFBiz.
      </para>
      <para>
          If you are looking for docbook files format examples, please
          look at the following files:
          <orderedlist>
            <listitem><para>An example for a chapter of a component at:
              applications/accounting/documents/Accounting.xml</para></listitem>
            <listitem><para>An example of a help screen:
              applications/accounting/data/helpdata/HELP_ACCOUNTING_main.xml</para></listitem>
            <listitem><para>An example of content creation:
              applications/accounting/data/AccountingHelpData.xml</para></listitem>
          </orderedlist>
      </para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Contributing a new help screen, a few steps.</title>
      <para>
          There is a difference between portlets and 'normal' screens. If a
          page contains a portlet, the general help of the myportal component is shown with
          at the bottom a list of the portlets used at that page. Help can be obtained by clicking on
          the relevant portlet.
      </para>
      <section>
        <title>Normal pages.</title>
        <para>
            So if you would like to create a new help menu for a certain
            screen, you need to do the following:
          <orderedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>In the HelpLink.ftl un-comment the ${helpTopic} variable so it will appear at the
                    top right hand of your screen.
                </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>
                    In the specific component data/helpData create the HELP_${helpTopic}.xml file. you can find an
                    example in the HELP_ACCOUNTING_main.xml file.
                </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>
                    Update/create the data/${componentName}HelpData.xml, an example can be found in the
                    AccountingHelpData.xml. If new make also an entry in the ofbiz-component.xml
                </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>
                    Load the HelpDataFile and the file should show up when you click on the help button.
                </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>
                    Submit the change to the git repository or create a diff file and attach it to a jira issue.
                </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>
                    If the help text is useful in the ofbiz document include it in the files in the document directory.
                </para>
            </listitem>
          </orderedlist>
        </para>

      <section>
        <title>Contributing a new Portlet help screen.</title>
        <para>
            Portlets are normally defined and explained in the ${component name}PortletData.xml files. An example
            of an portlet with an existing help screen have a look at WorkEffortPortletData.xml
        </para>
        <para>
            The content records for the help file is defined together with the portlet definition and the actual help
            file is store in the related component /data/helpdata directory with the name HELP_PORTLET_${portletId}.xml.
        </para>

    <section>
        <title><anchor xml:id="helpInternationalization"/>Internationalization of the help system</title>
        <para>
            Because the help system is making use of the content component, internationalization of the help files is very easy because
            it is a basic function of the content component. If you want to make a translation of an existing help file, make a copy in the same directory
            and make it unique by attaching the "_languageCode" at the end.
        </para>
        <para>
            Create, as also was done for the english version a dataresource and content record in the data/${componentName}HelpData.xml file.
            Then create an ContentAssoc record in data/${componentName}HelpData.xml file to associate this new file with the english file with the type
            ALTERNATE_LOCALE. Please find below an example from the ContentHelpData.xml for a Dutch version of the root help file.
            <programlisting>
    &amp;lt;!-- how to create alternative locales -->
    &amp;lt;DataResource dataResourceId="HELP_ROOT_NL" localeString="nl" dataResourceTypeId="OFBIZ_FILE"

            </programlisting>
            The switching between locales is from then on completely automatic.
