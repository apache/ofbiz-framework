= Datamodel component
The Apache OFBizÂ® Project
Release trunk

This is the core component in the OFBiz Base Application stack as it holds all entity definitions used by OFBiz in the various base and special purpose components. Entity definitions define the tables required in the RDBMS to create, read, update and delete records.

For an overview of the data models included, take a look at the code (look into \*code*.xml files).
