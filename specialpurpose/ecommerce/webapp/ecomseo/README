As you are probably aware, OFBiz has a pretty uncommon way of generating URLs.
Most of this has to do with the fact that OFBiz uses a servlet (ControlServlet) to handle all requests.
The servlet is mounted at /control, so that it won't interfere with other servlets.
Though functionally valid, this has the side effect that all URLs are actually created on /control, which is neither pretty, nor good by any measures of SEO.
It also means that a few 302 redirects are necessary to forward the user from / to /control/main.
It also makes requests more complicated, since many forwards are necessary whenever somebody wants to move away from this implementation.

Since this is hurtful to many of the implementers, The ecomseo functional changes contain:

    Removal of /control out of all the urls
    SEO-friendly URLS (with by default the suffix .html, see <category-url-suffix> in SeoConfig.xml)
    Configurable product/category and other URLs (see in in SeoConfig.xml)
    Frontpage mapping from /main to /
