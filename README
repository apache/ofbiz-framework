Welcome to Apache OFBiz!

If you have a release build all you need to run OFBiz is a 1.4 or 1.5 series
JDK (not just the JRE, the full J2SDK).

However if you have downloaded ofbiz from SVN then you should 
load the demo data (strongly advised) with the following command
on the command line:

ant run-install

Once that is properly setup just run the executable jar file
that comes with OFBiz, which is ofbiz.jar. To do this on the
command line you would run:

java -jar ofbiz.jar

There are also start scripts for Windows and Unix-based
operating systems, namely startofbiz.bat and startofbiz.sh.

Once OFBiz starts, you can look at the demo storefront at:
http://localhost:8080/ecommerce/

and the administration interface at:
http://localhost:8080/webtools/

You can log in with the user "admin" and password "ofbiz".

For more details about running a build, or for information on
getting, building, and running the source please see the 
Apache OFBiz Setup Guide:

http://docs.ofbiz.org/x/rwM

Note that running with the default configuration uses an
embedded Java database (Apache Derby), and embedded application
server components such as Tomcat, Geronimo (transaction manager), etc.

To prepare OFBiz for production use the Basic Production Setup Guide
is a great place to start. It is available here:

http://docs.ofbiz.org/x/j

For additional resources please see the OFBiz web site.

Enjoy!
