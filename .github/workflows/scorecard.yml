# policy, and support documentation.

#############################################################################
# Local testing of this workflow can be carried out using
# act (https://github.com/nektos/act).
#
# Act will set an environment variable, ACT, to indicate that it is running the workflow.
# This environment variable is used to skip some build steps, such as uploading
# results as artefacts of the workflow run.
#
# On first run, act will prompt you to select a micro, medium or large runner image. This
# workflow can be run using the medium image.
#
# Action, ossf/scorecard-action requires a GITHUB_TOKEN. To meet this
# requirement when using act you will need to create a Personal Access Token on GitHub.
# You can then run act using a command similar to:
#   act --workflows .github/workflows/scorecard.yml --secret GITHUB_TOKEN
# Act will then prompt you to enter your token.
