# Because of OFBIZ-10837 "Improve ObjectInputStream class."
# If you encounter a related issue (object not in the allowList),
# you must provide a complete list of objects to pass to ObjectInputStream through allowList property
# As an example, the a complete list of objects used by OFBiz OOTB is here in allowList.
# You will need to add your objects/classes to this list.

# OFBiz committers:
#     . don't forget to add new objects in SafeObjectInputStream class too (as default there).
#     . "foo" and "SerializationInjector" are used in OFBiz tests

#-- List of strings rejected for serialisation
#-- The same comments than for allowList apply to denyList
