# Because of OFBIZ-10837 - Improve ObjectInputStream class. 
# If you encounter a related issue (object not in the whitelist), 
# you must provide a complete list of objects to pass to ObjectInputStream 
# through ListOfSafeObjectsForInputStream property
# As an example, the a complete list of objects  used by OFBiz OOTB is here.
# You will need to add your objects/classes to this list.
# OFBiz committers: don't forget to add newobjects in SafeObjectInputStream class too (as default there).
