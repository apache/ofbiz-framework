/**
 * Based on the
 * <a href="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_AntiSamy_Project#Stage_2_-_Choosing_a_base_policy_file">AntiSamy Slashdot example</a>.
 * Slashdot (http://www.slashdot.org/) is a techie news site that allows users
 * to respond anonymously to news posts with very limited HTML markup. Now
 * Slashdot is not only one of the coolest sites around, it's also one that's
 * been subject to many different successful attacks. Even more unfortunate is
 * the fact that most of the attacks led users to the infamous goatse.cx picture
 * (please don't go look it up). The rules for Slashdot are fairly strict: users
 * can only submit the following HTML tags and no CSS: {@code <b>}, {@code <u>},
 * {@code <i>}, {@code <a>}, {@code <blockquote>}.
 * Accordingly, we've built a policy file that allows fairly similar
 * functionality. All text-formatting tags that operate directly on the font,
 * color or emphasis have been allowed.
