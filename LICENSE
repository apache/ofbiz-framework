      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

The BSD License

The following is a BSD license template. To generate your own license, change 
the values of OWNER, ORGANIZATION and YEAR from their original values as given 
here, and substitute your own.

Note: The advertising clause in the license appearing on BSD Unix files was 
officially rescinded by the Director of the Office of Technology Licensing of 
the University of California on July 22 1999. He states that clause 3 is 
"hereby deleted in its entirety."

Note the new BSD license is thus equivalent to the MIT License, except for the 
no-endorsement final clause.

<OWNER> = Regents of the University of California
<ORGANIZATION> = University of California, Berkeley
<YEAR> = 1998

In the original BSD license, both occurrences of the phrase "COPYRIGHT HOLDERS 
AND CONTRIBUTORS" in the disclaimer read "REGENTS AND CONTRIBUTORS".

=========================

______________________________________________________________________

IMPORTANT: PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING AGREEMENT CAREFULLY.

BY CLICKING ON THE "ACCEPT" BUTTON WHERE INDICATED, OR BY INSTALLING,
COPYING OR OTHERWISE USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU ARE DEEMED TO HAVE AGREED TO
THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT.

______________________________________________________________________

JPython version 1.1.x

  1. This LICENSE AGREEMENT is between the Corporation for National Research
     Initiatives, having an office at 1895 Preston White Drive, Reston, VA
     20191 ("CNRI"), and the Individual or Organization ("Licensee")
     accessing and using JPython version 1.1.x in source or binary form and
     its associated documentation as provided herein ("Software").

  2. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License Agreement, CNRI
     hereby grants Licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free,
     world-wide license to reproduce, analyze, test, perform and/or display
     publicly, prepare derivative works, distribute, and otherwise use the
     Software alone or in any derivative version, provided, however, that
     CNRI's License Agreement and CNRI's notice of copyright, i.e.,
     "Copyright ©1996-1999 Corporation for National Research Initiatives;
     All Rights Reserved" are both retained in the Software, alone or in any
     derivative version prepared by Licensee.

     Alternatively, in lieu of CNRI's License Agreement, Licensee may
     substitute the following text (omitting the quotes), provided, however,
     that such text is displayed prominently in the Software alone or in any
     derivative version prepared by Licensee: "JPython (Version 1.1.x) is
     made available subject to the terms and conditions in CNRI's License
     Agreement. This Agreement may be located on the Internet using the
     following unique, persistent identifier (known as a handle):
     1895.22/1006. The License may also be obtained from a proxy server on
     the Web using the following URL: http://hdl.handle.net/1895.22/1006."

  3. In the event Licensee prepares a derivative work that is based on or
     incorporates the Software or any part thereof, and wants to make the
     derivative work available to the public as provided herein, then
     Licensee hereby agrees to indicate in any such work, in a prominently
     visible way, the nature of the modifications made to CNRI's Software.

  4. Licensee may not use CNRI trademarks or trade name, including JPython
     or CNRI, in a trademark sense to endorse or promote products or
     services of Licensee, or any third party. Licensee may use the mark
     JPython in connection with Licensee's derivative versions that are
     based on or incorporate the Software, but only in the form
     "JPython-based ___________________," or equivalent.

  5. CNRI is making the Software available to Licensee on an "AS IS" basis.
     CNRI MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. BY WAY
     OF EXAMPLE, BUT NOT LIMITATION, CNRI MAKES NO AND DISCLAIMS ANY
     REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY
     PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR THAT THE USE OF THE SOFTWARE WILL NOT INFRINGE
     ANY THIRD PARTY RIGHTS.

  6. CNRI SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO LICENSEE OR OTHER USERS OF THE SOFTWARE FOR
     ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR LOSS AS A RESULT OF
     USING, MODIFYING OR DISTRIBUTING THE SOFTWARE, OR ANY DERIVATIVE
     THEREOF, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY THEREOF. SOME STATES DO NOT
     ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY SO THE ABOVE DISCLAIMER
     MAY NOT APPLY TO LICENSEE.

  7. This License Agreement may be terminated by CNRI (i) immediately upon
     written notice from CNRI of any material breach by the Licensee, if the
     nature of the breach is such that it cannot be promptly remedied; or
     (ii) sixty (60) days following notice from CNRI to Licensee of a
     material remediable breach, if Licensee has not remedied such breach
     within that sixty-day period.

  8. This License Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in all
     respects by the law of the State of Virginia, excluding conflict of law
     provisions. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to create any
     relationship of agency, partnership, or joint venture between CNRI and
     Licensee.

  9. By clicking on the "ACCEPT" button where indicated, or by installing,
     copying or otherwise using the Software, Licensee agrees to be bound by
     the terms and conditions of this License Agreement.
