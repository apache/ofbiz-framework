Dependency-Check Command Line
================
Dependency-Check Command Line can be used to check project dependencies for published security vulnerabilities. The checks
performed are a "best effort" and as such, there could be false positives as well as false negatives. However,
vulnerabilities in 3rd party components is a well-known problem and is currently documented in the 2013 OWASP
Top 10 as [A9 - Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A9-Using_Components_with_Known_Vulnerabilities).

Documentation and links to production binary releases can be found on the [github pages](http://jeremylong.github.io/DependencyCheck/dependency-check-cli/installation.html).
