<p>Three instances of OFBiz run on the OFBiz demo VM2 at https://ofbiz-vm2.apache.org.</p>
<ul>
<li>trunk: the trunk version</li>
<li>stable: the last stable version (currently 16.11)</li>
<li>old: the previous stable version (currently 13.07)</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the second instance of VM we use hence the 2 in its domain name. The root of https://ofbiz-vm2.apache.org is the so called bigfiles directory which is actually at /home/ofbizDemo/big-files</p>
<p>We own 3 Apache sub domains</p>
<ul>
<li>https://demo-trunk.ofbiz.apache.org</li>
<li>https://demo-stable.ofbiz.apache.org</li>
<li>https://demo-old.ofbiz.apache.org</li>
</ul>
<p>Trunk and stable use a Let's Encrypt certificate Because of technical issues we currently use a self-signed certificate for the old version</p>
<p>The Puppet configuration is at https://github.com/apache/infrastructure-puppet/blob/deployment/data/nodes/ofbiz-vm2.apache.org.yaml</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Note</em>: <strong>Only run the ofbiz demos using the 'ofbizDemo' user, never run as root.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>To do this sudo to the ofbizDemo user:

sudo -s -u ofbizDemo -H

sudo uses OTP (One Time Password), so you not only need to be registered as a sudoer (ask Infra) but also to use a tool like Donkey on Ubuntu (jleroux: I use that) to generate the OTP
Then you can start/stop as required.

To check if the demos are being run as the ofbizDemo user:

ps aux | grep ofbizDemo

The first column on the left tell you the username the demo is
being run as - it should say ofbizDemo (UID) or 9997 (GID) !

Type &#39;exit&#39; to exit the ofbizDemo user and return to your normal user.</code></pre>
<p>Also note that the demos are usually updated and started/stopped automatically using the check-svn-update.sh script in this directory, it is run by an ofbiz cron job every 24 hours at 3 AM. You should therefore only need to start/stop manually if there is a problem.</p>
<p>If you want to restart only a single instance you can respectively use</p>
<p>trunk-manual-nicely.sh stable-manual-nicely.sh old-manual-nicely.sh</p>
