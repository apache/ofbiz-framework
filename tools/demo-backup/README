3 instances of OFBiz on this VM:

trunk: the trunk version
stable: the last stable version (currently 13.07)
old: the previous stable version (currently 12.04)

{checking}
        Note: Only run the ofbiz demos using the 'ofbizDemo' user, never run as root.

        To do this sudo to the ofbizDemo user:

        sudo -s -u ofbizDemo -H

        then you can start/stop as required.

        To check if the demos are being run as the ofbizDemo user:

        ps aux | grep ofbizDemo

        The first column on the left tell you the username the demo is
        being run as - it should say ofbizDemo (UID) or 9997 (GID) !
{checking}

Also note that the demos are usually updated and started/stopped
automatically using the check-svn-update.sh script in this
directory, it is run by an ofbiz cron job every 24 hours at 3 AM.
You should therefore only need to start/stop manually if there is
a problem.

If you want to tackle only a single instance you can respectively use

trunk-manual.sh
stable-manual.sh
old-manual.sh

{checking}
        Type 'exit' to exit the ofbizDemo user and return to your normal user.
